# Daily Reporting

### In this repository you can find daily reports of things learned and tasks done(or pending) during DATA DEV courses in Simplon.co school
 
 Note that :
 
 - The date of the given day can be found in the name of .txt document in the form of ddmmyy. 
 
 - The status of a given task is marked within [ ], inside which : 
 
      Either  A = "acquis" (french for "done") or ECA = "en cours d'acquisition" (french for "pending")

      Or just a tick - [x] to mark a task as "Done"
 
 - I'll be using a mixure of french and english, since this is how my brain works !
