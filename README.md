# Welcome to my Daily Report Diary

### In this repository you can find daily reports of things learned and tasks done(or pending) during DATA DEV courses in Simplon.co school
 
 Note that :

- The files are organised by year and week (as per the name of the .md document)

- The exact date of the report can be found inside the .md document as the title of the corresponding report.

- The status of a given task is marked within [ ], inside which : 
 
      Either  A = "acquis" (french for "done") or ECA = "en cours d'acquisition" (french for "pending")

      Or just a tick - [x] to mark a task as "Done"
 
- I'll be using a mixure of french and english, since this is how my brain works !
