## L'algorithmique

L'algorithmique = L'algorithmique est l'étude et la production de règles et techniques qui sont impliquées dans la définition et la conception d'algorithmes, c'est-à-dire de processus systématiques de résolution d'un problème permettant de décrire précisément des étapes pour résoudre un problème algorithmique.

Deux manières de représenter un algorithme : PSEUDO-CODE ET DIAGRAMME

* PSEUDO-CODE = It's simply an implementation of an algorithm in the form of annotations and informative text written in plain English. It has no syntax like any of the programming language and thus can't be compiled or interpreted by the computer.

 -> Privilégié pcq plus facile de transformer en ligne de code ET peut s'adapter à n'importe quel language de code.

* DIAGRAM / FLOWCHART = A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task. The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.


### Start-up

Mode Projet: Equipe --> Code --> Dev.
     	     Projet --> Suivi en mode AGILE --> KANBAN ou SCRUM

Mode Produit --> Utilisateur. Start-up --> Pari sur l'équipe de Dev
     	     POC : Proof of concept = realization of a model or idea to demonstrate its feasability
	  --> MVP: Minimum Viable Product :  a development technique in which   new product or website is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. 
     	  --> RC<sub>1,...,i</sub> = Release Candidate : Realisation
   	  --> Beta = ??
	  --> Finally, Product.

* En tant que Développeur, on est évalué par notre capacité à faire de la **Modélisation** et de l'**algorithmique**.

### SCRUM master

It is the facilitator for an agile development team. **SCRUM** is a methodology that allows a team to self-organize and make changes quickly, in accoradance with agile principles. The **scrum master** manages the process for how information is exchanged.

During the daily meetings, which are sometimes called "scrums," the scrum master asks the team members these three questions: 

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Are there any impediments in your way?

The scrum master is responsible for:

1. Helping the team to reach consensus for what can be achieved during a specific period of time. (See sprint)
2. Helping the team to reach consensus during the daily scrum.
3. Helping the team to stay focused and follow the agreed-upon rules for daily scrums. (See pigs and chickens)
4. Removing obstacles that are impeding the team's progress.
5. Protecting the team from outside distractions.


- *sprint* = A set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review. duration is typically 30 days and it is reached by consensus. It is determined by the scrum master. During sprint : daily stand up meeting, brainstorming solutions to chalenges, project owner may participate but must remain silent unless to answer a question.

- *pigs and chickens* = Type of role an attendee can have during a scrum meeting. If the scrum attendee is a pig, it means he is directly accountable for completion of the task at hand. If the attendee is a chicken, he may be somewhat involved in the task at hand but is not the person whose "bacon is on the line" if the task doesn't get completed on time. At daily scrums, pigs may talk. Chickens must remain silent. N.B. also known as "boats and barnacles", "dogs and fleas" and "movie stars and agents".

### Cloud Computing

It is the on-demand delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like computing power, data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. It employs the pay-as-you-go pricing instead of buying, owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers.

- Cloud-based storage makes it possible to save files to a remote database and retrieve them on demand.
-Services can be both public and private—public services are provided online for a fee while private services are hosted on a network to specific clients.


- Types of Cloud services:
1. Email
2. Storage, backup and data retrieval
3. Creating and testing apps
4. Analyzing data
5. Audio and vieo streaming
6. Delivering software on demand

- Examples of cloud providers : Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM cloud, Kamatera

### API - application program interface

It is a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software applications. Basically an API specifies how software components should interact. They are also used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.
A good API makes it easier to develop a program by provinding all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.

There are different types of API : for operating systems, applications or websites. Most operating environments, such as MS-Windows, provide APIs, allowing programmers to write applications consistent with the operating environment. Today, APIs are also specified by websites. For example, Amazon or eBay APIs allow developers to use the existing retail infrastructure to create specialized web stores. Third-party software developers also use Web APIs to create software solutions for end-users.

- Some popular API examples:
1. Google Maps API: Google Maps APIs lets developers embed Google Maps on webpages using a JavaScript or Flash interface. The Google Maps API is designed to work on mobile devices and desktop browsers.

2. YouTube APIs: YouTube API: Google's APIs lets developers integrate YouTube videos and functionality into websites or applications. YouTube APIs include the YouTube Analytics API, YouTube Data API, YouTube Live Streaming API, YouTube Player APIs and others.

3. Twitter APIs: Twitter offers two APIs. The REST API allows developers to access core Twitter data and the Search API provides methods for developers to interact with Twitter Search and trends data.

4. Amazon Product Advertising API: Amazon's Product Advertising API gives developers access to Amazon's product selection and discovery functionality to advertise Amazon products to monetize a website.

## Trouver un Stage

Propositions :

* Cibler entreprises
* Viser les compétences qui vont avec les projets de cette entreprise
* Se proposer en promeetant d'avoir certaines compétences au 20 fevrier
* Travailler sur les compétences "promises" en classe avec Rafik
* Faire un Trello pour les compétences en quetion --> Partie de la Roadmap ou de l'arbre de compétence


## Utiliser SPHINX

Two ways you can build your documentation with Readthedocs:

* MkDocs (see work_environement)
* Sphinx

It is more interesting (apparently) to use Sphinx because it creates a table of content that allows cross referencing. This way one can avoid repetitions.
Another interesting point is that there is no need to start a local server to automatically modify the documentation as you go.
Additionally one is not obliged to use .srt format as you can use markdown notation by including extention .md in the conf.py file. 
Installation and user guide can be found on:
