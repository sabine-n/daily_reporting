## L'algorithmique

L'algorithmique = L'algorithmique est l'étude et la production de règles et techniques qui sont impliquées dans la définition et la conception d'algorithmes, c'est-à-dire de processus systématiques de résolution d'un problème permettant de décrire précisément des étapes pour résoudre un problème algorithmique.

Deux manières de représenter un algorithme : PSEUDO-CODE ET DIAGRAMME

* PSEUDO-CODE = It's simply an implementation of an algorithm in the form of annotations and informative text written in plain English. It has no syntax like any of the programming language and thus can't be compiled or interpreted by the computer.

 -> Privilégié pcq plus facile de transformer en ligne de code ET peut s'adapter à n'importe quel language de code.

* DIAGRAM / FLOWCHART = A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task. The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.


### Start-up

Mode Projet: Equipe --> Code --> Dev.
     	     Projet --> Suivi en mode AGILE --> KANBAN ou SCRUM

Mode Produit --> Utilisateur. Start-up --> Pari sur l'équipe de Dev
     	     POC : Proof of concept = realization of a model or idea to demonstrate its feasability
	  --> MVP: Minimum Viable Product :  a development technique in which   new product or website is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. 
     	  --> RC<sub>1,...,i</sub> = Release Candidate : Realisation
   	  --> Beta = ??
	  --> Finally, Product.

* En tant que Développeur, on est évalué par notre capacité à faire de la **Modélisation** et de l'**algorithmique**.


## Veille documentaire:

* **SCRUM master** is the facilitator for an agile development team. **SCRUM** is a methodology that allows a team to self-organize and make changes quickly, in accoradance with agile principles. The **scrum master** manages the process for how information is exchanged.

During the daily meetings, which are sometimes called "scrums," the scrum master asks the team members these three questions: 

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Are there any impediments in your way?

The scrum master is responsible for:

1. Helping the team to reach consensus for what can be achieved during a specific period of time. (See sprint)
2. Helping the team to reach consensus during the daily scrum.
3. Helping the team to stay focused and follow the agreed-upon rules for daily scrums. (See pigs and chickens)
4. Removing obstacles that are impeding the team's progress.
5. Protecting the team from outside distractions.


- *sprint* = A set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review. duration is typically 30 days and it is reached by consensus. It is determined by th escrum master. During sprint : daily stand up meeting, brainstorming solutions to chalenges, project owner may participate but must remain silent unless to answer a question.

- *pigs and chickens* = Type of role an attendee can have during a scrum meeting. If the scrum attendee is a pig, it means he is directly accountable for completion of the task at hand. If the attendee is a chicken, he may be somewhat involved in the task at hand but is not the person whose "bacon is on the line" if the task doesn't get completed on time. At daily scrums, pigs may talk. Chickens must remain silent. N.B. also known as "boats and barnacles", "dogs and fleas" and "movie stars and agents".
