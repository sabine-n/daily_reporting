Yesterday, at the end of the day I had a problem connecting mysql to python. The nature of the problem was of authentification type.
Problem was solved this morning by following the instructions on : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39281594/error-1698-28000-access-denied-for-user-rootlocalhost

Tasks:

   [A] Etablir une connection entre mysql et python
   [A] Chercher des bases de donn√©es accessibles en ligne. (data.gouv.fr, data/angers.fr)
